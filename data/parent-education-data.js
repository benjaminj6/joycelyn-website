data.par_1 = `Parent education is something that I am passionate about.  Because I believe that parents are my greatest allies in the process of teaching, I offer many forms of parent education.  All families who are new to the violin are required to sign up for 3 forty-five minute parent education lessons with me.  These parent education sessions are strictly between the teacher and the practice parent and occur before the child starts his/her first lesson.  In these lessons, we will cover bowhold technique, Suzuki methodology, practice techniques, lesson etiquette, and much more.`;
data.par_2 = `Additionally, I occasionally hold private parent-teacher conferences to check in on how the students are doing during home practice.  These meetings allow me to brainstorm with parents on how to meet their childâ€™s individual practice needs.`;
data.par_3 = `In addition to parent teacher conferences, I have partnered with a fellow violin teacher, Amanda Sansonetti to offer continuing parent education.  While students are in violin group class, parents will occasionally meet with a violin teacher (whoever is not teaching the group class that day) and discuss a violin topic (helping students practice, or helping them perform).  Our goal with these continuing parent education classes is to provide community and education to parents.`;
