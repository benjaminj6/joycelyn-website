	I started taking violin lessons at the age of four in a Suzuki violin program.  
	Since then, I have gained 17 years of violin experience and 12 years of piano experience. 
	In the past, I have studied violin at the prestigious Colburn school of music in Los Angeles.  
	After studying for four years under Elizabeth Larson, Sam Fischer, and Jason Uyeyama, 
	I received a Bachelor of Music degree in Violin Performance from Biola University.  
	My performing achievements include: soloing with the LLA Chamber Orchestra, leading the 
	Honors Biola String Quartet, performing in a masterclass taught by the world renowned Menahem 
	Pressler (Beaux Arts Trio), performing with the Biola Symphony Orchestra as assistant 
	concertmaster, and reaching level IX in MTAC (Piano Performance).`);

	needs of students all ages.`);
